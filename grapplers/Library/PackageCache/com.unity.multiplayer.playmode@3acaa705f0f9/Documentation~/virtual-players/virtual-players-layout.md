# Configuring the layout for Virtual Players

The Virtual Player can display and use the following parts of the Unity Interface
- [Console](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Console.html)
- [Game](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GameView.html)
- [Hierarchy](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Hierarchy.html)
- [Inspector](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html)
- [Scene](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheSceneView.html)
- [PlayMode Tools](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.netcode@1.6/manual/playmode-tool.html). This Window only appears in projects that use Netcode for Entities.
