# Virtual Players

Unity's [**Play mode**](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GameView.html) uses the main Editor Player to test your gameplay. By adding the **Multiplayer Play Mode (MPPM)** package, you can enable up to three additional Virtual Players*to the **Play mode** for a total of four Players to test projects with multiple Players.
