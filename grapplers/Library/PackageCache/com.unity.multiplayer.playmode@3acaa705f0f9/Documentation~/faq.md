# Frequently asked questions

## My Virtual Players aren't synchronized anymore, what can I do?

One potential cause of synchronization issues between the main Editor and Virtual Players in the Multiplayer Play Mode package is corruption within the `Library/VP` folder, which stores their data. If you suspect this is the case, try the following steps to resolve it:

- Close any active Virtual Player instances.
- Close the Unity Editor.
- Delete the `Library/VP folder` in your Unity project.
- Restart the Unity Editor.

The Multiplayer Play Mode package will automatically recreate the Library/VP folder. The Virtual Player data will then be regenerated either when you re-enable the Virtual Players through the Multiplayer Play Mode Window or when you launch a scenario containing Editor instances.

## How can I identify the currently running player instance from the code?

### For the main Editor instance

To find out if the current player is the main Editor or not, you can use the the [`IsMainEditor`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.multiplayer.playmode@latest?subfolder=/api/Unity.Multiplayer.Playmode.CurrentPlayer.html#Unity_Multiplayer_Playmode_CurrentPlayer_IsMainEditor) property from the [`CurrentPlayer`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.multiplayer.playmode@latest?subfolder=/api/Unity.Multiplayer.Playmode.CurrentPlayer.html) class.

### For Virtual Players

Several arguments are passed to an Editor instance when it's launched, including the `-name` argument. To find out which Editor instance is currently running, you can parse the launch arguments from the Editor instance. Look for the `-name` argument: the value should be `Player1` (for the main Editor) or `Player2`, `Player3`, or `Player4` (for Virtual Players).

### For local or remote instances

There isn't a generic API to know which player is currently running. One way to achieve parity with the main Editor instance would be to use the same `-name` argument as part of the advanced configuration for the local and remote instance. It will be up to you to choose a name and parse it from the code.

### Sample code to parse the `-name` argument

One way to parse the `-name` argument is by using the `System.Environment.GetCommandLineArgs()` method to get the list of the launch arguments and then search through that list.

C# example:

```csharp
using System;

public class Example : MonoBehaviour
{
    var arguments = Environment.GetCommandLineArgs();
    var playerName = arguments[arguments.IndexOf("-name") + 1];
    if(playerName == "Player2")
    {
        // Do something
    }
}

```

## My code assumes the uniqueness of the Editor and adding additional players breaks it. How can I fix it?

The best way to fix this is to update your code to check if the current player is the main Editor or not. You can use the `CurrentPlayer.IsMainEditor` property to check if the current player is the main Editor.

## What's the best way to assign a multiplayer role such as client, server, or client and server (host) to an instance?

The best way to assign a multiplayer role is to use the [Dedicated Server package](play-mode-dedicated-server.md). The use of tags for this purpose isn't recommended, because tags don't scale to local and remote instances.

## I have issues running a scenario on my Android device, what can I do?

Issues with Android platforms often happen when the generated APK doesn't match the platform CPU architecture, or if the scripting backend isn't supported by your Android platform.

### Example with Google Pixel phones

1. Go to **Project Settings** > **Player** > **Android** > **Configuration**.
2. Ensure the selected scripting backend is `IL2CPP` rather than `MONO`.
3. Ensure the target architecture is ARM64.

For other Android-based platforms, refer to the corresponding platform documentation to see what architecture and scripting backend options are recommended.

## What to do when I see the error `Build profile needs to match the current platform`?

To fix the `Build Profile needs to match the current platform` error, follow these steps:

1. Open the Build Profile window (**File** > **Build Profiles**).
2. In the **Platforms** list, select the platform that matches the platform that the Unity Editor is running on.
